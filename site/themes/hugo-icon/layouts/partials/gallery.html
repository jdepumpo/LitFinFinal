<h2>Churches — Ornate and Mad</h2>
<h4>I listen to money singing. It’s like looking down
  <br>
  From long french windows at a provincial town,   
  <br>
The slums, the canal, the churches ornate and mad
<br>
  In the evening sun. It is intensely sad.</h4>
  <a target="_blank" href="https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/48421/money-56d229a672857">Philip Larkin, "Money" from Collected Poems.</a>
<hr>
<p>The last stanza of Philip Larkin's poem stood out ot me from the start. With just 34 words, he not only depicts the small town that money is serenading from the window, but also sets up an intriguing dichotomy between the "slums" and the "churches." Larkin moves from left to right across the cityscape — the poor slums, the canal, and the "ornate and mad" churches. It is almost as if the canal serves as a moat, to keep the poverty of the slums away from the churches of the town.
<br>As the narrator "look[s] down" over the town, he seems to be somewhat disconnected from society below. He can watch and observe the poverty of the slums and the ornate churches, as the "evening sun" sets, and yet he seemingly has no agency — there is nothing he can do to effect the "intensely sad" state of affairs, other than simply watch, as day turns to night.</p>

      <hr>
      <p>Matthew Chapter 25 provides us with a number of metaphors to describe the grandeur of heaven. The chapter starts with the Parable of the Ten Virgins -- or at least five virgins, the ones who remembered to bring lots of oil. If that Parable is a little too Harvey Weinstein for you, don't worry, apparently the kingdom of heaven is also analogous to a greedy and unjust slave master! The message of the Parable of the Talents, it seems, is to follow exactly the instructions of our master (presumably God), and to use our talents in order to please God. If you don't, you will be smited and damned to hell.<br>
      In the last entry, I commented that the narrator in “Money” seemed to lack agency. It occurs to me that this lack of agency is inherent in the context of Christianity. In fact, the Parable of the Talents commands us to give up control, to put our agency into the hands of God. As John Milton slowly goes blind, one wouldn't blame him for being angry at his God. After all, he is quite literally being "cast... into the outer darkness." Unfortunately, I think Milton conflates going blind with regaining his agency from God -- how can he give his talents in service of God if God has “taken” them away from him? By making that conflation, Milton can conveniently side step the cruelty of God, both in the Parable and in “making” him blind.</p>

        <hr>
       <p>I ended up watching the entire <i>Ozark</i> series after seeing snippets of it in class. One thing that struck me was the liberal use of Bob Seger music throughout the series, particularly Marty's (Jason Bateman) connection with the song "Still The Same" (see episode 3). While I occasionally enjoy the golden oldies, when I think of Bob Seger, it's hard to resist that feeling you got when "Night Moves" was playing a bit too loudly in the background the last time you were at Chili's five years ago. It's not <i>bad</i> per se, but if you hadn't gotten that coupon for a free Molten Chocolate Lava Cake™ with the purchase of an entree, would you really be there?<br>
      For some reason though, "Still The Same" really resonated with me, probably because it also resonates so much with Marty. He knows he's in a very dangerous situation, stuck between a rock and a hard place. He knows the best advice - "never play the game too long." And yet, here he is, still the same, moving game to game. Season 1 left it unclear - just as Seger does - whether the game will eventually catch up with Marty Byrde. Luckily, Netflix has renewed the series for a second season, so maybe we'll find out.</p>

      <h2>Jugglers, Sorcerers, and Witches, Oh My</h2>

        Soul-killing witches that deform the body,<br>

      <a>Act 1, Scene 2, lines 97-102 | </a>
      <a>Comedy of Errors, William Shakespeare</a>
      <hr>
      <p>Antipholus of Syracuse lays out his fears and prejudices of Ephesus. Humans are averse to unknowns, so Antipholus begins filling in the unknown with his fears. He sees Ephesus as a world of “dark-working sorcerers” and “soul-killing witches,” when the reality is that Ephesus is filled with people just like him -- literally. Now obviously, this is not exactly an earth shattering revelation. It is this fear of the “other” that keeps Antipholus and Dromio of learning the identity of their counterparts, and is a main driver of the storyline. Nevertheless, it is an important motif to recognize, and one that Shakespeare will continually overuse in pursuit of comedy.<br> Just a few years after Comedy of Errors was written, Shakespeare would pen the Merchant of Venice. He takes some of these same concepts -- fear of the “other”, prejudice, and identity -- but takes a far more serious approach. Clearly a Comedy of Errors had an effect on his later work, and perhaps is why Shakespeare took on these issues much more directly in the latter play. It resulted in a very progressive take on identity, and perhaps Comedy of Errors influenced that.</p>

      <h2>Shipwrecked</h2>
      <h4>I smil'd to my self at the sight of this money, O drug! said I aloud, what art thou good for? Thou art not worth to me, no not the taking off of the ground, one of those knives is worth all this heap, I have no manner of use for thee, e'en remain where thou art, and go to the bottom as a creature whose life is not worth saving.

      <a>Robinson Crusoe, Daniel Defoe</a>
      <hr>
      <p>Robinson Crusoe is an interesting choice for the theme of this class. Interesting because money and the economy is inherently social -- it requires exchange. Considering the fact that for vast portions of the storyline Robinson Crusoe is completely alone on an island, this certainly makes those themes difficult to explore. There simply is no market or economy. However, the book is not completely irrelevant. In fact, because Crusoe alone is responsible for keeping himself alive and surviving, it brings a pretty profound commentary on labor to the story. Money, coins, capital -- alone it is all worthless in this world. Labor, on the other hand? It is the only thing on the island that is inherently valuable. It is the only thing that is keeping Crusoe alive.</p>

      <h2>Scrivening into a Tizzy</h2>
      <h4>As I walked home in a pensive mood, my vanity got the better of my pity. I could not but highly plume myself on my masterly management in getting rid of Bartleby. Masterly I call it, and such it must appear to any dispassionate thinker. The beauty of my procedure seemed to consist in its perfect quietness. There was no vulgar bullying, no bravado of any sort, no choleric hectoring, and striding to and fro across the apartment, jerking out vehement commands for Bartleby to bundle himself off with his beggarly traps. Nothing of the kind. Without loudly bidding Bartleby depart—as an inferior genius might have done—I assumed the ground that depart he must; and upon that assumption built all I had to say. The more I thought over my procedure, the more I was charmed with it.</h4>
      <a>Bartleby, the Scrivener, Herman Melville</a>
      <hr>
      <p>I loved reading Barteby. Crazy employees. Crazy employers. Capitalist abuses. It really is the whole package. The lawyer/manager/narrator manages to give us a window into not only his mindset, but I think the mindset of many managers in the corporate world. They are thoughts of efficiency and productivity. How do I reach a desired outcome with the least resistance? This mindset is valuable to corporations because increased efficiency allows more labor exploitation, more efficient use of capital, and in this case, the firing of an employee without making a scene -- that way other employees don’t have to contemplate that they might be next. But this mindset also conveniently allows managers to ignore their human impulses, and their broader societal obligations. Who are they to cut off one’s means of production? How much labor have they put into the effort? It seems in the narrator’s case, some of these questions begin to bubble to the top and he begins to question his actions. At least it's a start.</p>

      <h2>Irish Phrenology</h2>
      <h4>Suddenly the animal in the man stirred and woke; the evil instincts that in him were so close to the surface leaped to life, shouting and clamoring.</h4>
      <a>McTeague, Frank Norris (22)</a>
      <hr>
      <p>Literary critics were quick to dismiss <i>McTeague</i> as a racist, politically incorrect novel. Despite this, it was profoundly popular, and by virtue of us reading it for this class, it must have had some impact. Frank Norris definitely dabbles with racism, particularly anti-Irish and anti-Semitic descriptions of characters. McTeague’s Irish background is pointed out by way of animal comparisons. If you stripped out only Norris’s descriptions of the characters, it would not be difficult to point out the Phrenology-lite that he engages in. It is somewhat unclear to me if the book was so popular because people were willing to overlook these elements, or they agreed with these elements. Were the literary critics all morally pure, and the reading public at large not? It is probably not that simple.</p>

      <h2>Olivar and Flint</h2>
      <h4>Cities controlled by big companies are old hat in science fiction. My grandmother left a whole bookcase of old science fiction novels. The company-city subgenre always seemed to star a hero who outsmarted, overthrew, or escaped "the company." I've never seen one where the hero fought like hell to get taken in and underpaid by the company. In real life, that's the way it will be. That's the way it always is.</h4>
      <a>Parable of the Sower, Octavia Butler</a>
      <hr>
      <p>As we begin to understand what towns like Olivar are in the novel, I was glad to see Lauren bring up their precedent in the quote above. I immediately thought of the coal mining company towns of the industrial revolution era, where underpaid laborers scrape by with whatever is offered by the company in their town. These companies had nearly complete control over their workers lives. Company towns are long gone, but local governments are often beholden to the same economic interests that those corporations were. Flint, Michigan’s lead-laden water provided the perfect example of this, but now we know that 11 cities in New Jersey alone have higher lead levels than Flint did. It is a deadly reminder that when we allow local governments to operate with a company town mindset -- acting on economic impulses instead of societal ones -- that they can be just as exploitative.</p>

      <h2>I Can't Escape Gmail</h2>
      <h4>And it’s eliminated my ability to just talk to you.” He was still talking. “I mean, I can’t send you emails, because you immediately forward them to someone else. I can’t send you a photo, because you post it on your own profile. And meanwhile, your company is scanning all of our messages for information they can monetize. Don’t you think this is insane?</h4>
      <a>The Circle, Dave Eggers</a>
      <hr>
      <p>For about six months I ran my own email server. I was concerned that Google had the ability to scan and monetize all of my emails, so I wanted to take full control of my data, by sending, receiving, and storing on my own server. It was more an experiment than anything, to see if I had the technical knowledge to be able to do it. It was way more difficult than I expected. Storage is the main issue. I figured that because emails are essentially pretty small text files, I wouldn’t need that much storage. What I forgot to consider was that 97% of the emails I receive are these big bloated spam emails with huge catalogs of products and services. The vast majority I don’t even open, but they kept coming. Before long I had to buy more storage space on the server, and then more, and then more. And then I realized that even if <i>I</i> didn’t use Gmail, everyone else still did -- Google could just as easily scan my replies to any Gmail user. The server was too costly to maintain, and I no longer saw the benefit if Google was going to be able to scan my emails anyway. So I gave up. I went back to Gmail, and Google won.</p>

      <h2>Don't Be Evil</h2>
      <h4>How long do you want these messages to remain secret? [...] I want them to remain secret for as long as men are capable of evil.</h4>
      <a>Cryptonomicon, Neal Stephenson</a>
      <hr>
      <p>I have a 4096-bit encryption key. I do not know anyone else with a 4096-bit encryption key. For me, that is currently the main issue with encryption technologies - both parties have to understand what encryption is and have a public key to be able to communicate with each other. In crypto-lingo this is called the key “handshake.” Both parties must have a hand in order to be able to shake them. Some apps are solving this problem -- apps like WhatsApp and Signal do all of the encryption and handshakes in the background so the user never knows what is happening. I guess this is kind of the point, that technology takes care of the hard work for us. In this case though, it means that no one has an incentive to learn what encryption is or how it works or why they would want to use it. To make matters worse, the most popular encrypted messaging app is WhatsApp, which is owned by Facebook. They claim to have fully vetted encryption that is maintained all the way from sender to receiver and vice-versa. However, the way that they’ve implemented the encryption is proprietary, so we simply have to take them at their word. Pardon me for having a hard time believing that they don’t want to exploit our messages.</p>
