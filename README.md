# Commonplace "Book"

**My final project for ENGL 3400 - Topics in Literature and Finance**

### About

I review a number of the books we explored for class, including their themes, my thoughts, and how they compare.

### Credits

This site is built on [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) using an ddapted design from [H5co](http://freehtml5.co/). Thanks to [SteveLane](https://github.com/SteveLane/) for a Hugo port of this theme.
